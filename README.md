1 Kafka and Go

Kafka message producer and consumer implemented with Go:
- Kafka-Serial-Producer.go
- Kafka-Serial-Consumer.go

The base code for the applications used in this experimentation are copied from existing Github projects. Primarily the source code is used as is. Some of the variable names are extended and new comments are added to improve my own understanding.

The source of the original code is documented in the individual applications.

2 NATS and Go

NATS message producer and consumer implemented with Go:
- NATS-Serial-Producer.go
- NATS-Serial-Consumer.go
